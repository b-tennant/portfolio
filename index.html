        <h2 class="about">About me</h2>
      
        <p>
          My name's Benjamin Tennant and I'm from Staffordshire, not too far from
          Birmingham, UK. After excelling in <span class="black-text">Economics</span> at A level, I decided to
          continue reading the subject at University. Before going to University, 
          I took a medical gap year. During this time out I under-went two rounds of 
          complex knee surgery following a nasty rugby injury, as well as a brief period
          of travel. I worked part-time at Waitrose throughout the entirity of my degree
          and went on to gain <span class="black-text">upper second class honours.</span> Outside of term time I completed
          two finance internships, one of which was at Barclays within their Corporate Bank.
        </p>
          <p>
          Continual development of my commercial awareness led me to recognise the growing
          dependancy upon tech to drive growth and efficiency within businesses. 
          With this in mind, as well as the COVID-19 job market, I decided
          to enroll on an intensive <span class="black-text">Software Development training programme with _nology.</span>
          This allows me to upskill, by gaining future-proof programming skills, working 
          with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and React.js. While on the course I will 
          also be involved in a client project.
        </p>

        <h2>Industry Experience<h2>

          <h3>Barclays Corporate Bank</h3>
          <p>
            During my time at Barclays in Birmingham, I was exposed to various departments of their corproate bank. This included 
            areas such as: <span class="black-text">trade finance, credit risk, wealth management and special asset management.</span>
            I also spent time at their <span class="black-text">'egale lab' where the bank promotes innovation through tech by supporting start-ups</span>, offering
            them open work space at a specialsit offsite innovation hub at Birmingham's Icentrum.
            Out of hours I carried out <span class="black-text">fundamental and technical analysis</span> on a case study and presented my findings to two directors
            at the end of my internship.
          </p>
      
          <h3>Eastcote Wealth Management</h3>
          <p>
            At Eastcote, I gained a well-rounded insight into the services offered by a wealth management firm, as well as the day to day responsibilities of a financial advisor.
            I assessed and applied the benefits of placing capital in funds built up of a <span class="black-text">global blend of asset classes,</span> enabling advisors to spread risk and achieve sustainable growth. 
            I identified the need to place capital in equity weighted funds when clients aim to achieve maximum growth, along with the associated precautions. 
            Worked alongside investment specialists; using online resources to track indices and monitor funds allowing us to best place clients’ funds based upon their preferred level of risk and annual growth expectations. 
            Partnered with a Director in attending two off-site client meetings, one of which we enabled said client to save £80,000 by re-allocating pension funds in her quest to purchase a BTL property.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Waitrose & Partners</h3>
            <p>I not only worked for the partnership throught my final year of A levels but transferred branches so I could <span class="black-text">work throughout the duration of my degree too.</span>
              My role as a supermarket assistant and delivery driver meant I was constatly in contact with and <span class="black-text">building relationships with customers.</span> This expereince was invaluable, as it showed me the crucial link
              between prodividing genuine customer service and building brand loyalty in a competitive retail market. The aspect of my role that I enjoyed most was 
              addressing issues presented by unhappy customers and ensuring they left the store feeling satisfied with not only the solution I had provided, but their overall experience in store.
